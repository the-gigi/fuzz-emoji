# fuzz-emoji

A fuzzy search for emojis. If you're looking for an emoji by name, but you don't know exactly
what's the name fuzz-emoji is here to help.

For example, suppose you want to get the `fire` emoji ðŸ”¥, but you don't know it's called `fire`.
You can ask fuzz-emoji for `flame` and it will return the ðŸ”¥. How cool is that?
